  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 13/04/2025</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2006 Range Rover Sport Reg: 123efd (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 13/04/2025.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 13 April 2025, the customer, Will Varney, brought his vehicle, a 2006 Range Rover Sport with registration 123efd, to Ritter Australia for routine servicing. Prior to the service appointment, Mr. Varney had documented evidence demonstrating the vehicle&#39;s condition, indicating it was in good repair without any visible damage. This evidence includes dated photographs and a recent inspection report which confirm the absence of any defects or damage.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the service, Mr. Varney collected his vehicle from Ritter Australia. Shortly thereafter, he noticed significant damage that was not present prior to the service. The nature of the damage includes [specific details of the damage if known, e.g., scratches, dents, mechanical issues], which Mr. Varney asserts occurred while the vehicle was in the care of Ritter Australia.</p>
<p>Mr. Varney promptly contacted Ritter Australia to report the issue, seeking an explanation and resolution. However, Ritter Australia has not acknowledged any liability or provided satisfactory evidence to dispute Mr. Varney&#39;s claims. This narrative outlines Mr. Varney&#39;s contention that the damage occurred during the service period and seeks appropriate compensation or repair from Ritter Australia for the damages sustained.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Ritter Australia is obligated to provide services with due care and skill. As the service provider, you assumed a duty of care as a bailee for reward when my 2006 Range Rover Sport (Reg: 123efd) was entrusted to you. This duty requires you to take reasonable care to prevent damage while the vehicle is in your possession. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a failure to exercise the necessary care and skill, potentially constituting a breach of the ACL guarantees and negligence. Consequently, Ritter Australia may be liable for the resultant damage to my vehicle while it was under your care in Victoria.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I hereby demand that Ritter Australia compensates me for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1200, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This amount is based on the quotes obtained for the necessary repairs, which can be provided upon request. I expect prompt payment of the full amount to resolve this matter. Please note that no alternative remedy has been offered, and I urge you to address this demand without delay to avoid further action.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>Ritter Australia is hereby required to respond and comply with the demands set forth in this letter within 14 business days, by 12 February 2029. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in the matter being escalated to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) for resolution. Additionally, a formal complaint will be lodged with Consumer Affairs Victoria. Should these steps become necessary, please be advised that Will Varney intends to seek recovery of all associated costs through legal proceedings. This letter serves as the final notice before such actions are undertaken.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Will Varney<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
