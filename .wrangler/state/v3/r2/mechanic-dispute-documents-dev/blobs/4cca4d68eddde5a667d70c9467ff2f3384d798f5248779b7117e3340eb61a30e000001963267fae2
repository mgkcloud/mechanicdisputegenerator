  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 31/03/4233</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2004 ranger rover (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 31/03/4233.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 31 March 4233, the customer, Wll Var, entrusted their 2004 Range Rover to the mechanic, Ritter, for a scheduled service. Prior to the service, the vehicle was in a well-maintained condition, as evidenced by photographic documentation and a recent inspection report verifying its state before being handed over to Ritter. The service appointment was intended for routine maintenance, with no known issues reported by Wll Var at the time of drop-off.</p>
<p>Upon retrieving the vehicle from Ritter, Wll Var noticed damage that was not present before the service. The exact nature of the damage was not specified, but it was significant enough to prompt concern and a subsequent examination by Wll Var. Despite the immediate notification to Ritter regarding this issue, the mechanic has not acknowledged any responsibility or provided an explanation for the damage observed.</p>
<p>The sequence of events suggests that the damage occurred while the vehicle was under the care of Ritter. Wll Var seeks to resolve this matter by obtaining a satisfactory explanation and appropriate compensation for the damage incurred during the service period. The customer remains open to dialogue to address this dispute amicably.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Ritter is required to provide services with due care and skill, as per Section 60 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. As a bailee for reward, Ritter also owed a duty of care to safeguard my 2004 Range Rover while it was in their custody. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a breach of these statutory guarantees and common law duties. Ritter may be liable for negligence if the damage resulted from a failure to exercise reasonable care or skill. I expect rectification of this matter, including compensation for any loss incurred due to this breach of duty and failure to meet the ACL guarantees.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>We hereby demand payment for the full cost of repairs, amounting to $1230, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This amount reflects the estimated expenses necessary to restore the vehicle to its original condition prior to your intervention. We are prepared to provide quotes to substantiate this claim. Immediate settlement of this amount is expected, as no alternative remedy is being offered at this time.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>Ritter, you are hereby required to respond and comply with this demand within 14 business days, by 2029-02-12. Should you fail to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline, we shall have no alternative but to escalate this matter. We intend to lodge a complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and pursue the matter further with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Please be advised that we will seek recovery of all associated costs through legal proceedings. This notice serves as the final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably before formal legal action is initiated.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
