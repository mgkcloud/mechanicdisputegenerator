  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 12/02/1223</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2006 Range Rover Sport (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 12/02/1223.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 12th February 1223, Mr. Will Varney entrusted his 2006 Range Rover Sport to the care of Ritter, a local mechanic, for routine service. Prior to the service appointment, the vehicle was in a pristine condition with no visible damage, as evidenced by photographs taken by Mr. Varney on the morning of the service, which clearly show the vehicle&#39;s undamaged state.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the service, Mr. Varney retrieved his vehicle from Ritter&#39;s workshop. It was at this point that he noticed significant damage to both the front and rear of the Range Rover Sport. When confronted, Ritter acknowledged causing damage to the rear of the vehicle but denied any responsibility for the damage to the front.</p>
<p>Mr. Varney is disputing this claim, asserting that the vehicle had no such damage when it was handed over for service. The discrepancy between the acknowledged rear damage and the disputed front damage remains unresolved. Mr. Varney is seeking to address this issue formally, as the damage was clearly not present prior to the vehicle being in Ritter&#39;s care.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), services must be provided with due care and skill. As the mechanic, you, Ritter, were entrusted with my 2006 Range Rover Sport and held a duty of care as a bailee for reward. This duty required you to ensure the vehicle was not damaged while in your possession. The alleged damage detailed elsewhere in this letter suggests a failure to provide services with the requisite care and skill, potentially constituting negligence and a breach of the ACL guarantees. Consequently, you may be liable for any resulting damage to my vehicle. I urge you to address this matter promptly to avoid further legal action.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I hereby formally demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1300, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This amount reflects the necessary expenses to restore the vehicle to its original condition prior to the service rendered by you. I am prepared to provide quotes substantiating this claim. No alternative remedy is offered; therefore, prompt payment is expected to resolve this matter without further action.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>Ritter, you are hereby required to respond and comply with the demands set forth in this letter within 14 business days, no later than 2028-11-04. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in immediate escalation of the matter. We intend to lodge a complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and initiate proceedings with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to recover all costs associated with this claim. This letter serves as your final notice before such actions are taken. We urge you to consider this matter seriously to avoid further legal complications.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
