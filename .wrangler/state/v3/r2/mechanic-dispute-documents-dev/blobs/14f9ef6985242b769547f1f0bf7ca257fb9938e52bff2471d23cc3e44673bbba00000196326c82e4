  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 12/02/2345</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 3004 range rover (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 12/02/2345.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 2345-02-12, the customer, dfdfg, entrusted their 3004 Range Rover to the mechanic, sdfsdf, for routine maintenance. Prior to the service, the vehicle was in pristine condition, as evidenced by photographs and inspection records available with the customer. The Range Rover was delivered to sdfsdf&#39;s premises for the agreed service, with no visible or reported damages at the time of handover.</p>
<p>Following the completion of the service, dfdfg retrieved the vehicle from the mechanic&#39;s workshop. Upon inspection, dfdfg noticed damage that had not been present before the service. The exact nature of the disputed damage is unspecified, but it was significant enough to prompt immediate concern and contact with the mechanic.</p>
<p>The mechanic, sdfsdf, has not acknowledged any responsibility for the damage, and there has been no admission of liability. The customer, dfdfg, asserts that the vehicle was damaged while in the care of the mechanic, as it was delivered without any such issues. This claim is supported by the pre-service condition evidence held by dfdfg. The customer seeks resolution and compensation for the damage incurred during the period the vehicle was under the mechanic&#39;s supervision.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), specifically section 60, sdfsdf is required to provide services with due care and skill. This includes ensuring that the 3004 Range Rover was not damaged while in their care. As a bailee for reward, sdfsdf had a duty of care to protect the vehicle from harm. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a potential breach of these obligations. Additionally, if the damage resulted from negligence or failure to meet the ACL guarantees, sdfsdf may be liable for any resulting loss. It is imperative that this matter is addressed promptly to rectify the damage and avoid further legal action.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>We hereby demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1200, necessitated by the damage caused by your workshop. This amount represents the total expenses required to rectify the issues, and quotes supporting this estimate can be provided upon request. We expect prompt settlement of this amount to avoid further action. Please be advised that no alternative remedy has been offered, and we anticipate your immediate compliance with this demand.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>You are hereby required to respond and comply with the demands outlined in this letter within 14 business days, no later than 2029-02-12. Failure to do so will compel us to escalate the matter without further notice. We intend to lodge a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and initiate proceedings with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to seek resolution. Please be advised that we will pursue recovery of all associated costs through these legal channels. This letter serves as the final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably before legal escalation.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  dfdfg<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
