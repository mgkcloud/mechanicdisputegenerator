**RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 16/04/2025**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2006 Raindriver Sport. (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 16/04/2025.

**Background:**
On or around 16 April 2025, William brought his 2006 Raindriver Sport to Ritters for routine mechanical service. Prior to this service appointment, William had documented the vehicle's condition, which showed no visible damage or mechanical issues beyond those intended for routine maintenance. This documentation includes photographs and a detailed condition report, establishing the vehicle's state before being entrusted to Ritters.

Upon completion of the service, William collected the Raindriver Sport and immediately noticed damage that was not present prior to the service. The nature of the damage has not been specified but is significant enough to warrant dispute. William promptly reported this issue to Ritters, seeking acknowledgment or remediation, but received no admission of responsibility from the mechanic.

Given the evidence of the vehicle's pre-service condition and the timing of the damage discovery, William alleges the damage occurred while the vehicle was under the care of Ritters. The sequence of events suggests the need for a thorough investigation and resolution. William is seeking a response from Ritters to address this issue and to discuss potential remedies for the damage sustained. 

**Legal Responsibility:**
Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), Ritters is required to provide services with due care and skill, as stipulated by the consumer guarantees. As the mechanic entrusted with the 2006 Raindriver Sport, Ritters also assumed the role of a bailee for reward, thereby incurring a duty of care to ensure the vehicle's safety and return in its original condition. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a potential breach of these obligations. If Ritters failed to exercise reasonable care or did not meet the ACL guarantees, they may be liable for the damages incurred. I urge you to address this matter promptly to avoid further legal action. 


**Demand for Compensation:**
I hereby formally demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1300, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This demand is based on the quotes obtained, which can be provided upon request. No alternative remedy is offered, and I expect immediate payment to resolve this matter expeditiously. 

**Deadline and Further Action:**
You are hereby required to respond and comply with the demands outlined in this letter within 14 business days, by 2028-11-04. Should you fail to provide a satisfactory response within this timeframe, I will have no alternative but to escalate the matter. This will involve lodging a complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and initiating proceedings with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Furthermore, I will seek recovery of all associated costs through legal proceedings. Please consider this your final notice before such actions are taken. 

I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.

Yours faithfully,


William.
Owner of Vehicle
