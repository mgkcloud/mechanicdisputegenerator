  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 12/04/3333</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2333 dugr charger (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 12/04/3333.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On 3333-04-12, Taka Rachi brought their vehicle, a 2333 dugr charger, to the mechanic known as sdfsd for routine servicing. Prior to the service, Mr. Rachi had documented the condition of the vehicle, including photographs and maintenance records, which clearly indicated that the vehicle was in good operational and physical condition. The purpose of the service was to conduct standard maintenance checks and routine servicing tasks. Upon collecting the vehicle after the service was completed, Mr. Rachi noticed damage that had not been present prior to the service. The nature of the damage has not been specified in detail, but it was significant enough to warrant concern and was immediately apparent to Mr. Rachi upon inspection. Despite notifying the mechanic sdfsd of this discrepancy, no acknowledgment of the damage was made by the mechanic, nor was any responsibility accepted. Mr. Rachi is seeking resolution for the damages incurred while the vehicle was under the care of sdfsd, based on the clear evidence of the vehicle&#39;s pre-service condition and the subsequent discovery of damage post-service.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), as codified in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), services must be provided with due care and skill. As the mechanic, sdfsd, you were required to ensure that the vehicle, a 2333 dugr charger, was maintained without incurring damage while in your care. Furthermore, as a bailee for reward, you held a duty of care to safeguard the vehicle from harm. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a breach of these obligations. If the damage resulted from negligence or a failure to meet the ACL guarantees, sdfsd may be liable for the costs associated with rectifying the damage. I urge you to address this matter promptly to avoid further legal action.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I formally demand that you compensate me for the full cost of repairs, which is estimated at $1300, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. I expect payment for these repairs promptly. Should you require, I can provide quotes to substantiate this amount. No alternative remedy is offered at this time, and I expect immediate action to resolve this matter.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>You are hereby required to respond and comply with the demands outlined in this letter within 14 business days, by 2029-02-12. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in further action. Specifically, I intend to escalate this matter to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) and lodge a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria. Additionally, I will seek to recover all associated costs through legal proceedings. Please consider this letter as the final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably before such steps are taken.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Taka Rachi.<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
