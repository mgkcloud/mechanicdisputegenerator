  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 20/09/2234</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2016 Range. Rover Sport (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 20/09/2234.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 2234-09-20, Mr. Will Varney entrusted his 2016 Range Rover Sport to Ritter Australia for routine servicing. Prior to the service appointment, the vehicle was in pristine condition, as documented by photographic evidence taken by Mr. Varney. Upon completion of the service, Mr. Varney retrieved his vehicle and immediately noticed a scratch on the back, which Ritter Australia acknowledged. However, Mr. Varney observed additional damage that was not present prior to the service, which Ritter Australia did not acknowledge. This additional damage, which remains unspecified in detail, was not part of the vehicle&#39;s condition when it was handed over to the mechanics. Mr. Varney is now seeking compensation for the full extent of the damages incurred while the vehicle was under the care of Ritter Australia. The sequence of events suggests the damage occurred during the service period, as the vehicle was confirmed to be in excellent condition before being left at the mechanic&#39;s facility.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), specifically sections 60 and 61, Ritter Australia is obligated to provide services with due care and skill. As the vehicle, a 2016 Range Rover Sport, was in Ritter Australia&#39;s possession, you assumed the role of a bailee for reward, which imposes a duty of care to ensure the vehicle is returned in the condition it was received. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a potential breach of these statutory guarantees and your duty of care. Consequently, Ritter Australia may be liable for damages resulting from negligence or failure to meet the ACL guarantees. I urge you to address this matter promptly to avoid further legal action.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I hereby demand payment for the full cost of repairs, amounting to $1199.99, necessitated by the damage caused at your workshop. This amount reflects the estimated expenses required to rectify the issues, for which detailed quotes are available upon request. No alternative remedy is proposed; hence, I expect prompt settlement of this amount to resolve the matter amicably.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>Ritter Australia is hereby notified that you are required to respond to and comply with the demands outlined in this letter within 14 business days, by 2028-11-04. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in the matter being escalated to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) for resolution. Additionally, a complaint will be lodged with Consumer Affairs Victoria. Please be advised that should this matter proceed to legal action, we will seek recovery of all associated costs. This notice serves as the final opportunity to resolve the issue amicably before formal proceedings are initiated.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Will Varney<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
