  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 13/09/1998</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2006 Range Rover Sport (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 13/09/1998.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 13 September 1998, William Varney entrusted his 2006 Range Rover Sport to Ritter Aus for routine service. Prior to the service appointment, Mr. Varney ensured the vehicle was in pristine condition, with documented evidence supporting its excellent state. Upon delivering the vehicle to Ritter Aus, Mr. Varney did not observe any noticeable damages or mechanical issues. The service was expected to be standard, with no major repairs anticipated. However, upon retrieving the vehicle, Mr. Varney immediately noticed significant damage, which had not been present at the time of delivery. Despite a thorough examination, the specific nature of the damage was not detailed by the mechanic, and Ritter Aus did not acknowledge any responsibility. Mr. Varney asserts that the damage occurred while the vehicle was under the care of Ritter Aus, as it was not present before the service appointment, and seeks rectification for the damages incurred during this period. The precise timeline of events following the service and the exact nature of the disputed damage remain to be further elaborated, pending additional investigation and communication with Ritter Aus.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), specifically sections 60 and 61, services provided must be rendered with due care and skill, which applies to the maintenance and repair of my vehicle, a 2006 Range Rover Sport, by Ritter Aus. As a bailee for reward, Ritter Aus owed a duty of care to ensure the vehicle was returned in the same condition as received, barring reasonable wear and tear. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a breach of this duty and failure to meet the statutory guarantees under the ACL. Consequently, Ritter Aus may be liable for negligence and any resulting loss or damage incurred during the period the vehicle was under their care.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I am writing to formally demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1300, required to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This amount represents the necessary expenses incurred due to your actions, and I expect prompt reimbursement. Please be advised that no alternative remedy is being offered, and I anticipate immediate settlement of this matter. Should you require, quotes substantiating the repair costs can be provided upon request.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>Ritter Aus, you are hereby required to respond to this letter and comply with the demands set forth within 14 business days, by 2029-02-12. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in immediate escalation of the matter. We intend to lodge a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and pursue the matter further with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Additionally, we will seek recovery of all associated costs through legal proceedings. This notice serves as the final opportunity to resolve the issue amicably before legal action is initiated.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  William Varney<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
