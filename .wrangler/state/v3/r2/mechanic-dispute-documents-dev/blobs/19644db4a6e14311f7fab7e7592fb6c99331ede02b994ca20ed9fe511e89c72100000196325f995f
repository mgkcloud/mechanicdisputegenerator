  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 23/06/5233</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 2998 Range Rvger Srt (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 23/06/5233.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 5233-06-23, Will Varnryy entrusted his 2998 Range Rvger Srt to the care of Rserser for routine maintenance. Prior to the service, Mr. Varnryy meticulously documented the condition of his vehicle, including photographs and a checklist, confirming the vehicle was in pristine condition with no visible damage. This documentation serves as evidence of the vehicle&#39;s state before it was handed over to the mechanic.</p>
<p>The vehicle was delivered to Rserser on the aforementioned date for scheduled servicing. Upon completion of the service, Mr. Varnryy retrieved his vehicle from Rserser&#39;s premises. Shortly thereafter, he discovered damage that was not present before the service. The nature of the damage, while not specified in this narrative, was significant enough to prompt immediate concern and a thorough inspection.</p>
<p>Mr. Varnryy promptly brought the issue to the attention of Rserser, seeking clarification and resolution. However, Rserser did not acknowledge any responsibility for the damage, nor was there any prior indication or report from the mechanic about the vehicle&#39;s condition post-service.</p>
<p>Given this sequence of events, and the clear evidence of the vehicle&#39;s pre-service condition, Mr. Varnryy is pursuing a claim for damages, alleging that the damage occurred while the vehicle was under the care of Rserser.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), specifically sections 60 and 61, Rserser is required to provide services with due care and skill. As the mechanic responsible for the 2998 Range Rvger Srt, Rserser owed a duty of care as a bailee for reward, ensuring the vehicle remained undamaged while in their custody. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a potential breach of these statutory guarantees and a failure to exercise reasonable care and skill. This may constitute negligence, rendering Rserser liable for the damage incurred. Accordingly, I request that Rserser address this matter promptly to resolve the issue and compensate for the damage caused while the vehicle was under their care.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>I hereby demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1300, necessitated by the damage caused to my vehicle while under your workshop&#39;s care. This amount reflects the expenses required to restore the vehicle to its original condition prior to the damage incurred. I expect full payment of this amount promptly. Should this demand not be met, I am prepared to pursue further legal action to recover the costs. Please be advised that quotes substantiating this amount can be provided upon request.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>You are hereby required to respond to this demand and comply with the requested actions within 14 business days, by 12 February 2029. Failure to provide a satisfactory response by this deadline will result in the matter being escalated to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) for resolution. Additionally, a formal complaint may be lodged with Consumer Affairs Victoria. Please be advised that should legal proceedings become necessary, we will seek recovery of all associated costs. This notice serves as the final opportunity to resolve this matter amicably before further legal action is pursued.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Will Varnryy<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
