  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND – Damage to Vehicle  During Service on 12/02/2345</h2>

  <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a 3004 range rover (Registration: ), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around 12/02/2345.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>On or around 2345-02-12, the customer, dfdfg, entrusted their 3004 Range Rover to the care of the mechanic, sdfsdf, for routine maintenance services. Prior to the service, the vehicle was thoroughly inspected by the customer, and its pristine condition was documented with photographic evidence. The Range Rover was delivered to the mechanic’s premises on the agreed date, with the understanding that all necessary care would be taken to ensure the vehicle remained undamaged throughout the service process. Upon retrieval of the vehicle post-service, the customer observed significant damage that was not present before the vehicle was handed over. The nature of the damage was immediately apparent and included [specific details of the damage]. Despite the customer&#39;s prompt notification to the mechanic, sdfsdf, regarding the newly discovered damage, there was no acknowledgment or acceptance of responsibility from the mechanic. The customer contends that the damage occurred while the vehicle was under the mechanic’s supervision and seeks resolution for the incurred damages. The customer maintains that the vehicle was in excellent condition prior to the service, as corroborated by the pre-service documentation available.</p>
 

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  <p>Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), specifically sections 60 and 61, service providers are required to carry out services with due care and skill. In this instance, as the mechanic, you, sdfsdf, were entrusted with the care of my 3004 Range Rover and thus held a duty of care as a bailee for reward. This duty obligates you to ensure that the vehicle is returned in the same condition as received, barring fair wear and tear. The alleged damage, as detailed elsewhere in this letter, suggests a breach of these statutory guarantees and your duty of care. Consequently, you may be liable for damages resulting from any negligence or failure to meet the ACL&#39;s guarantees, warranting immediate rectification or compensation for the damage incurred.</p>
 


  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  <p>We hereby demand payment for the full cost of repairs, estimated at $1200, necessary to rectify the damage caused by your workshop. This demand is based on the quotes available upon request. Immediate payment is required to resolve this matter. Failure to comply with this demand may result in further legal action to recover the costs incurred.</p>
 

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  <p>The recipient, sdfsdf, is hereby notified that a response to this demand is required within 14 business days, by 2029-02-12. Failure to provide a satisfactory response and comply with the terms of this demand by the specified deadline will result in immediate escalation of the matter. We intend to lodge a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and pursue the matter through the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT). Additionally, we will seek recovery of all associated costs through legal proceedings. This letter serves as the final notice before such actions are undertaken.</p>
 

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  dfdfg<br>
  Owner of Vehicle
