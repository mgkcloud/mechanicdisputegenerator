{{#if incidentNarrative.text}}
{{{incidentNarrative.text}}}
{{else}}
On {{formatDate incidentDetails.serviceDate}}, I took my {{vehicleDetails.year}} {{vehicleDetails.make}} {{vehicleDetails.model}} to {{recipientInfo.name}} for servicing. When I collected the vehicle, I discovered damage that was not present when I left the vehicle in their care.

The damage consists of {{incidentDetails.disputedDamageDescription}}.
{{/if}}

{{#if remedyDetails.demandAmount}}I have obtained a repair quote of {{formatCurrency remedyDetails.demandAmount}}.{{/if}}

**Legal Basis for Claim:**
{{#if legalBasis.summaryText}}
{{{legalBasis.summaryText}}}
{{else}}
Under the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), services must be provided with due care and skill. This is a consumer guarantee that cannot be excluded. The ACL requires that a service provider must take all necessary care to avoid loss or damage to the consumer's property.

By damaging my vehicle while it was in their care, {{recipientInfo.name}} has failed to meet this guarantee.

{{#if timelineEvents}}
{{#each timelineEvents}}
{{@index}}. {{this.description}}{{#if this.timestamp}} on {{formatDate this.timestamp}}{{/if}}
{{/each}}
{{else}}
1. I immediately notified the business of the damage after collection.
2. I sent a formal letter of demand on {{formatDate metadata.generatedDate}} requesting compensation for the repair costs.
3. The business has not satisfactorily resolved this matter.
{{/if}}

**Evidence to Bring to Hearing:**
- Photos of the damage
- Service invoice and proof of payment
{{#if remedyDetails.demandAmount}}- Independent repair quote{{/if}}
- Copy of letter of demand
{{#if incidentDetails.preServiceEvidenceAvailable}}- Evidence of vehicle condition before service{{/if}}
- Timeline of events
{{#if remedyDetails.insuranceDetails.insurer}}- Insurance claim details (Insurer: {{remedyDetails.insuranceDetails.insurer}}, Claim #: {{remedyDetails.insuranceDetails.claimNumber}}){{/if}}

**What to Expect at the Tribunal:**
1. The hearing will be relatively informal
2. You will present your case first, then the mechanic will respond
3. The Tribunal member may ask questions of both parties
4. Bring three copies of all documents (one for you, one for the mechanic, one for the Tribunal)
5. Speak clearly and stick to the facts
6. Focus on how the mechanic breached the consumer guarantee of due care and skill

**Possible Outcomes:**
If successful, the Tribunal may order the mechanic to pay you compensation for the repair costs. If unsuccessful, you may be required to pay the mechanic's filing fee.

**Filing Fee:**
For claims up to $3,000: approximately $72
For claims up to $15,000: approximately $240
(Fee waivers may be available in certain circumstances)

**Time Limit:**
Applications must generally be made within 6 years of the incident, but it's best to file as soon as possible.
