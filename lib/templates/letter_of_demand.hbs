  <h2>RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle {{vehicleDetails.registration}} During Service on {{formatDate incidentDetails.serviceDate}}</h2>

  <p>Dear {{#if recipientInfo.contactPerson}}{{recipientInfo.contactPerson}}{{else}}Sir/Madam{{/if}},</p>

  <p>I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a {{vehicleDetails.year}} {{vehicleDetails.make}} {{vehicleDetails.model}} (Registration: {{vehicleDetails.registration}}), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around {{formatDate incidentDetails.serviceDate}}.</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  {{#if incidentNarrative.text}}
  {{{incidentNarrative.text}}} {{! Use triple braces for potentially HTML-formatted AI text }}
  {{else}}
  <p>[Detailed narrative of the incident, including service requested, condition before service, damage discovered, and timeline, should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]</p>
  {{/if}}

  <h3>Legal Responsibility</h3>
  {{#if legalBasis.summaryText}}
  {{{legalBasis.summaryText}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
  {{else}}
  <p>[Summary of legal basis, referencing Australian Consumer Law guarantees (due care and skill) and bailment principles, should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]</p>
  {{/if}}

  {{#if paymentDetails.paymentMadeUnderProtest}}
  <h3>Payment Under Protest</h3>
  <p>Please note that the service invoice{{#if paymentDetails.invoiceNumber}} (Invoice No: {{paymentDetails.invoiceNumber}}){{/if}} for {{formatCurrency paymentDetails.protestedInvoiceAmount}} was paid on {{formatDate paymentDetails.paymentDate}} <strong>under protest</strong>. This payment was made solely to secure the release of my vehicle due to the assertion of a repairer's lien and does not constitute acceptance of the service quality, agreement with the charges, or waiver of my rights regarding the damage caused while the vehicle was in your care.</p>
  {{/if}}

  <h3>Demand for Compensation</h3>
  {{#if remedyStatement.text}}
  {{{remedyStatement.text}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
  {{else}}
  <p>[Clear statement demanding specific compensation (e.g., payment for repair costs, insurance excess reimbursement) should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]</p>
  {{/if}}

  <h3>Deadline and Further Action</h3>
  {{#if escalationText.text}}
  {{{escalationText.text}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
  {{else}}
  <p>[Statement setting a deadline for response (e.g., 10 business days) and outlining intended escalation steps (e.g., lodging complaint with state consumer affairs body, initiating proceedings in relevant tribunal like VCAT/NCAT/QCAT) should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]</p>
  <p>You are required to provide written confirmation of your agreement to resolve this matter as demanded within 10 business days from the date of this letter (i.e., by {{formatDate incidentDetails.calculatedResponseDate}}).</p>
  <p>If I do not receive a satisfactory response by {{formatDate incidentDetails.calculatedResponseDate}}, I will escalate this matter without further notice. This may include lodging a formal complaint with the relevant state consumer protection agency (e.g., Consumer Affairs {{state}}) and initiating legal proceedings against {{recipientInfo.name}} in the appropriate tribunal or court (e.g., {{escalationDetails.escalationBody}}) to recover all losses, including repair costs, insurance excess (if applicable), potential increases in premiums, and associated legal costs.</p>
  {{/if}}

  <p>I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.</p>

  <p>Yours faithfully,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
  {{senderInfo.name}}<br>
  Owner of Vehicle {{vehicleDetails.registration}}
