**RE: LETTER OF DEMAND â€“ Damage to Vehicle {{vehicleDetails.registration}} During Service on {{formatDate incidentDetails.serviceDate}}**

Dear {{#if recipientInfo.contactPerson}}{{recipientInfo.contactPerson}}{{else}}Sir/Madam{{/if}},

I am writing to formally demand compensation for damage allegedly caused to my vehicle, a {{vehicleDetails.year}} {{vehicleDetails.make}} {{vehicleDetails.model}} (Registration: {{vehicleDetails.registration}}), while it was in the care and custody of your workshop for service on or around {{formatDate incidentDetails.serviceDate}}.

**Background:**
{{#if incidentNarrative.text}}
{{{incidentNarrative.text}}} {{! Use triple braces for potentially HTML-formatted AI text }}
{{else}}
[Detailed narrative of the incident, including service requested, condition before service, damage discovered, and timeline, should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]
{{/if}}

**Legal Responsibility:**
{{#if legalBasis.summaryText}}
{{{legalBasis.summaryText}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
{{else}}
[Summary of legal basis, referencing Australian Consumer Law guarantees (due care and skill) and bailment principles, should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]
{{/if}}

{{#if paymentDetails.paymentMadeUnderProtest}}
**Payment Under Protest:**
Please note that the service invoice{{#if paymentDetails.invoiceNumber}} (Invoice No: {{paymentDetails.invoiceNumber}}){{/if}} for {{formatCurrency paymentDetails.protestedInvoiceAmount}} was paid on {{formatDate paymentDetails.paymentDate}} **under protest**. This payment was made solely to secure the release of my vehicle due to the assertion of a repairer's lien and does not constitute acceptance of the service quality, agreement with the charges, or waiver of my rights regarding the damage caused while the vehicle was in your care.
{{/if}}

**Demand for Compensation:**
{{#if remedyStatement.text}}
{{{remedyStatement.text}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
{{else}}
[Clear statement demanding specific compensation (e.g., payment for repair costs, insurance excess reimbursement) should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]
{{/if}}

**Deadline and Further Action:**
{{#if escalationText.text}}
{{{escalationText.text}}} {{! Use triple braces }}
{{else}}
[Statement setting a deadline for response (e.g., 10 business days) and outlining intended escalation steps (e.g., lodging complaint with state consumer affairs body, initiating proceedings in relevant tribunal like VCAT/NCAT/QCAT) should be inserted here. AI generation failed or section missing.]
You are required to provide written confirmation of your agreement to resolve this matter as demanded within 10 business days from the date of this letter (i.e., by {{formatDate incidentDetails.calculatedResponseDate}}).

If I do not receive a satisfactory response by {{formatDate incidentDetails.calculatedResponseDate}}, I will escalate this matter without further notice. This may include lodging a formal complaint with the relevant state consumer protection agency (e.g., Consumer Affairs {{state}}) and initiating legal proceedings against {{recipientInfo.name}} in the appropriate tribunal or court (e.g., {{escalationDetails.escalationBody}}) to recover all losses, including repair costs, insurance excess (if applicable), potential increases in premiums, and associated legal costs.
{{/if}}

I trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.

Yours faithfully,


{{senderInfo.name}}
Owner of Vehicle {{vehicleDetails.registration}}
