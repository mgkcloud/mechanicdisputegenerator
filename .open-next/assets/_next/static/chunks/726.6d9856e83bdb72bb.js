Upon collection on [Collection Date/Time], I immediately identified new damage to the [Damage Location(s)] which was not present when I delivered the vehicle. \n[Optional: Add brief timeline summary if complex, e.g., "Your staff member [Staff Name, if known] acknowledged causing the [Specific part, e.g., rear] damage... However, responsibility for the [Other part, e.g., front] damage was denied..."]\n\n**Evidence:**\nThe damage consists of [Detailed Damage Description].\nI have photographic evidence clearly showing the vehicle\'s undamaged condition prior to the service and the new damage present upon collection. \n[Optional: Mention other evidence]\n  - I have obtained an independent repair quote from [Repair Shop Name] for $[Repair Cost].\n  - My insurer, [Insurance Company Name], has been notified (Claim #[Insurance Claim Number]). The applicable excess is $[Insurance Excess].\n\n**Legal Liability:**\nUnder Australian law, particularly the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) which applies in [State, e.g., Victoria], you have a legal obligation to provide services with due care and skill. This includes taking all necessary care to prevent loss or damage to my property while it is in your possession. \nFurthermore, under the principles of bailment, as the bailee holding my vehicle for reward, you owe a duty of care. The law presumes you are liable for damage occurring in your custody unless you can prove you took reasonable care, which has not been demonstrated.\nThe damage to my vehicle is a direct result of a breach of these obligations.\n\n[Optional: Include if payment was made under protest]\n**Payment Under Protest:**\nPlease note that the service invoice ([Invoice Number]) for $[Service Cost] was paid on [Payment Date] **under protest**. This payment was made solely to secure the release of my vehicle and does not constitute acceptance of the service quality or waiver of my rights regarding the damage caused.\n\n**Demand for Remedy:**\nI demand that you take immediate responsibility for the damage caused. To resolve this matter, you must either:\n1.  **Arrange and cover the full cost of repairs** for all damage ([Damage Location(s)]) at a reputable repairer agreed upon by us, restoring the vehicle to its pre-service condition. OR\n2.  **Reimburse me for the full repair cost** of $[Repair Cost] as quoted by [Repair Shop Name]. OR\n3.  **If proceeding via my insurance:** Formally accept full liability in writing to my insurer ([Insurance Company Name], Claim #[Insurance Claim Number]) and reimburse me for the insurance excess of $[Insurance Excess]. Acknowledgment of liability is required to prevent adverse impacts on my insurance record and future premiums.\n\nI require your written confirmation of how you will remedy this situation within **[Response Deadline, e.g., 10 business days]** from the date of this letter (i.e., by [Response Deadline Date]).\n\nPlease be advised that I am **not** willing to sign any release agreement that waives future claims or includes a non-disparagement clause as a condition of receiving the compensation I am legally entitled to.\n\n**Failure to Comply:**\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response and commitment to rectify the damage by [Response Deadline Date], I will escalate this matter without further notice. This will include lodging a formal complaint with Consumer Affairs Victoria and initiating legal proceedings against [Mechanic Business Name] in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT) to recover all losses, including repair costs, insurance excess, potential increases in premiums, and associated costs.\n\nI trust this matter can be resolved amicably and promptly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\n______________________\n[Your Name]\nOwner of Vehicle [Vehicle Registration]\n  ',consumer_complaint:"\n**CONSUMER AFFAIRS VICTORIA COMPLAINT**\n\n**Consumer Details:**\nName: [Your Name]\nAddress: [Your Address]\nPhone: [Your Phone]\nEmail: [Your Email]\n\n**Trader Details:**\nBusiness Name: [Mechanic Business Name]\nAddress: [Mechanic Address]\nABN: [Mechanic ABN]\nPhone: [Mechanic Phone]\nEmail: [Mechanic Email]\n\n**Complaint Details:**\n\n**Product/Service:**\nVehicle servicing provided on [Service Date]\n\n**Vehicle Details:**\nMake: [Vehicle Make]\nModel: [Vehicle Model]\nYear: [Vehicle Year]\nRegistration: [Vehicle Registration]\n\n**Description of Issue:**\nI brought my vehicle to [Mechanic Business Name] for servicing on [Service Date].
